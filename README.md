# 🐍 Python Learning Projects

Welcome to my **Python learning repository**!  
Here I store projects I develop as I learn Python. This repository will grow over time as I explore new concepts and build more projects.

## 🚀 Current Projects

### 🧮 Calculator
A terminal-based calculator featuring:  
- Colorful output with **Colorama**  
- Previous calculation **history tracking**  
- Supports basic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`


### 🔐 Cryptography CLI Tool
A large **educational cryptography project** focused on classical ciphers, cryptanalysis, and CLI design.

This project goes far beyond basic encryption and includes:
- Interactive menus (arrow navigation)
- Full English 🇬🇧 / French 🇫🇷 support
- Encryption, decryption, and **brute-force cracking**
- File export system with user-selected content
- Error handling and input validation
- Modular architecture

**Implemented ciphers:**
- Caesar
- ROT (13, 18, 47)
- Polyalphabetic Caesar
- Vigenère
- Affine Caesar
- One-Time Pad (OTP)

**Cryptanalysis implemented:**
- Caesar brute force
- Polyalphabetic brute force
- Affine brute force
- Advanced Vigenère crack:
  - Kasiski examination
  - N-gram analysis (bi-gram / tri-gram)
  - Frequency analysis
  - Dictionary & syllable scoring
  - Adaptive parameters based on text length
  - Performance-bounded cracking (< 20s)

📁 This project has its **own detailed README** inside its folder.
