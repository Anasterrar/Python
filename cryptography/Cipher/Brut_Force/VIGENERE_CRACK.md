# 🔓 Vigenère Cipher — Cryptanalysis (Crack)

This module implements a **practical and adaptive crack of the Vigenère cipher**, using classical cryptanalysis techniques combined with heuristic scoring.

The goal is to **recover both the key and the plaintext without any prior information**.

## 1️⃣ Key Length Detection (Kasiski Examination)

The algorithm starts by searching for **repeated n-grams** in the ciphertext:
- **Trigrams** are used by default
- **Bigrams** are used automatically for short texts

For each repeated pattern:
- The distances between occurrences are measured
- These distances are analyzed to extract **probable key lengths**

A maximum key length is enforced to avoid excessive computation.

If no repetition is found, the crack is aborted.

## 2️⃣ Column Decomposition

For each candidate key length:
- The ciphertext is split into multiple columns
- Each column contains letters encrypted with the same shift

Each column can therefore be treated as an independent **Caesar cipher**.

---

## 3️⃣ Frequency Analysis (per Column)

For every column:
- All 26 possible Caesar shifts are tested
- Each shift is scored using **letter frequency analysis**
  - French and English distributions are supported

Only the **Top-N best shifts** are kept for each column to limit the search space.

---

## 4️⃣ Key Reconstruction

Candidate keys are generated by combining the retained shifts from all columns.

To keep execution time reasonable:
- Only a **prefix of the ciphertext** is decrypted during this phase
- This allows fast elimination of bad candidates

---

## 5️⃣ Global Scoring & Selection

Each decrypted candidate is evaluated using:
- Global letter frequency
- Dictionary word detection
- Syllable detection

The candidate with the **highest overall score** is selected as the final result.

---

## ⏱ Performance Control

Execution time is controlled through:
- Adaptive **Top-N** selection
- Maximum key length limits
- Early filtering and pruning
- Partial decryption during brute-force

These parameters are automatically adjusted depending on text length.

---

## ⚠️ Limits

This crack relies on **statistical weaknesses** of the Vigenère cipher and works best when:
- The ciphertext is long enough
- The key is significantly shorter than the message  
  *(practically limited to about 1/4 of the text length)*

This implementation is **purely educational** and should not be used against modern cryptographic systems.
