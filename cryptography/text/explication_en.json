  "title": "Classic Caesar",
  "description": "The Caesar cipher shifts each letter of the message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. Letters that go past Z wrap around to the beginning.",
  "formula": "E(x) = (x + k) mod 26",
  "example": "With k = 3: A → D, B → E, Z → C. The word \"HELLO\" becomes \"KHOOR\"."
},

"rot": {
  "title": "ROT",
  "description": "ROT ciphers are a family of substitution ciphers derived from the Caesar cipher. The principle consists of rotating characters by a fixed number of positions within a defined character set. Depending on the chosen ROT variant, the rotation can apply to letters only, digits only, or a wider range of characters such as printable ASCII symbols.",
  "formula": "E(x) = (x + k) mod N",
  "example": "ROT ciphers apply a fixed rotation: ROT13 shifts letters by 13 positions, ROT18 combines ROT13 for letters and ROT5 for digits, and ROT47 rotates all printable ASCII characters. The same operation is often used for both encryption and decryption."

"rot13": {
  "title": "ROT13",
  "description": "ROT13 is a simple substitution cipher and a variant of the Caesar cipher using a fixed shift of 13 positions in the alphabet. It is symmetrical, meaning the same operation is used for both encryption and decryption.",
  "formula": "E(x) = (x + 13) mod 26",
  "example": "ROT13: A → N, B → O, N → A. The word \"PYTHON\" becomes \"CLGUBA\"."
},

"rot18": {
  "title": "ROT18",
  "description": "ROT18 is a combination of two ciphers: ROT13 applied to letters (A–Z) and ROT5 applied to digits (0–9). All other characters remain unchanged.",
  "formula": "Letters: E(x) = (x + 13) mod 26 | Digits: E(n) = (n + 5) mod 10",
  "example": "ROT18: A → N, 1 → 6. The text \"HELLO123\" becomes \"URYYB678\"."
},

"rot47": {
  "title": "ROT47",
  "description": "ROT47 is an extension of the Caesar cipher that operates on all printable ASCII characters (from '!' to '~'). It uses a fixed shift of 47 positions and encrypts letters, digits, and symbols.",
  "formula": "E(x) = 33 + ((x − 33 + 47) mod 94)",
  "example": "ROT47: A → p, ! → P. The text \"Hello!\" becomes \"w6==@P\"."
},

"poly": {
  "title": "Polyalphabetic Caesar",
  "description": "The polyalphabetic cipher uses multiple successive shifts instead of a single one. Each letter is encrypted with a different shift.",
  "formula": "E(xᵢ) = (xᵢ + kᵢ) mod 26",
  "example": "With key '1, 2, 3': A → B, B → D, C → F. The key pattern repeats across the message."
},

"vigenere": {
  "title": "Vigenere",
  "description": "The Vigenere cipher is a polyalphabetic encryption method based on a keyword. Each letter of the message is shifted according to the corresponding letter of the keyword.",
  "formula": "E(xᵢ) = (xᵢ + kᵢ) mod 26",
  "example": "With key \"KEY\": A → K, B → F, C → A. The word \"HELLO\" becomes \"RIJVS\"."

"affine_manual": {
  "title": "Affine Caesar (Manual keys)",
  "description": "Manually choose the two keys. The first key(a) must be prime to 26 in order to allow decryption (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25)..",
  "formula": "E(x) = (a × x + b) mod 26",
  "example": "With a = 5 and b = 8: A → I, B → N. The word \"HELLO\" becomes \"RCLLA\"."

"affine_auto": {
  "title": "Affine Caesar (Automatic keys)",
  "description": "The first key(a) is chosen randomly from a list of numbers prime to 26 (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25) in order to allow decryption.",
  "formula": "E(x) = (a × x + b) mod 26",

"affine": {
  "title": "Affine Caesar",
  "description": "The affine cipher improves the classic Caesar cipher by using an affine mathematical function with two keys. The first key must be coprime with 26 to allow decryption.",
  "formula": "E(x) = (a × x + b) mod 26",
  "example": "With a = 5 and b = 8: A → I, B → N. The word \"HELLO\" becomes \"RCLLA\"."
